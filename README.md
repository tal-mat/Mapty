# Mapty

Mapty is a mapping application designed to allow users to log and visualize their outdoor activities, such as running and cycling, on interactive maps. 
It features a user-friendly interface for adding activities on the map and storing them in local storage until the user decides to delete them. 
The application integrates with mapping services and was created in the JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann, written in Vanilla JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
